This is a proof of concept system for an event/callback system similar to
node.js in pure python

This is part of my release more code ambition, when I go off on a tangent, that
I'll never finish I want the world to have them!

currently this example implements:
*	event loop
*	adding event handlers
*	posting events
*	a timer event!!

does not implement a proper shutdown (you may still have to kill the process)
event listeners don't get removed, and the get from queue is a blocking call,
so ... fix it ;)

TODO: 
*	figure out how to "unblock" queue.get (perhaps posting a fake message to it, like "quit") and detecting this?
*	fix time.sleep in the timer - cause if an interval needs 1000 seconds to fulfull, you may have to wait for that length of time to exit the damned app
*	make the timer callback function's return value cancel or leave the timer intact ... ? confuses me at the moment :D
